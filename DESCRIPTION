Description: Demixed PCA (dPCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that automatically discovers and highlights the essential features of complex population activities. The population activity is decomposed into a few demixed components that capture most of the variance in the data and that highlight the dynamic tuning of the population to various task parameters, such as time, stimuli, decisions, etc.
